# laundry
#A small scale laundry service provider wants to develop a system to maintain their customer details. They should be able to create/view/update their customer details in the system. The system should generate a transaction slip with a unique ID when a customer deposits clothes for laundering. The slip should contain details such as type of each cloth, the type of laundry required, cost, and delivery date. The system should internally allocate clothes to appropriate service points and collect back all the clothes belonging to a particular customer. A transaction should be closed when a customer makes the payment and takes delivery of their clothes. The service provider should be able to generate weekly reports
